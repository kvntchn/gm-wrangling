Caveats:
"1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"2. Population figures in this table for 1979 and 1981-89 are intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population of the"
"United States. Note that the state and county population estimates for these years are not consistent with national estimates."

"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
