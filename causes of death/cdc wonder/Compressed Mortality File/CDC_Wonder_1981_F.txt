Caveats:
"1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"2. Population figures in this table for 1979 and 1981-89 are intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population of the"
"United States. Note that the state and county population estimates for these years are not consistent with national estimates."

"figures for 1991-98 are bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population."
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
